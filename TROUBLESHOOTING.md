## Setup and Configuration Issues

### ‚ùå "API Key Invalid" or Authentication Errors

**Symptoms**: Agent returns authentication errors, mentions invalid API keys, or fails to access services.

**Diagnosis Steps**:
1. Check your `.env` file format:
   ```bash
   # Correct format (no spaces around =)
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
   
   # Incorrect format (spaces cause issues)
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = your_key_here
   ```

2. Verify key completeness:
   ```bash
   # Check if your key is complete (no truncation)
   echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   ```

3. Test API key directly:
   ```bash
   # For Anthropic API
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
   ```

**Solutions**:
- **Format Issues**: Remove all spaces around `=` in `.env` file
- **Incomplete Keys**: Re-copy API key from service dashboard
- **Expired Keys**: Generate new API key in service console
- **Permission Issues**: Verify API key has required permissions
- **File Location**: Ensure `.env` file is in project root directory

**Prevention**:
- Use `.env.example` as template
- Set up API key rotation schedule
- Monitor API key usage limits
- Enable API key alerts in service dashboards

---

### üîß Environment File Not Loading

**Symptoms**: Agents can't access API keys, environment variables not found.

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check if .env file exists
ls -la .env

# Check file contents (be careful - contains sensitive data)
head -5 .env

# Verify file permissions
ls -la .env
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Missing File**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. **Wrong Location**: Move `.env` to project root directory
3. **Permission Issues**: Set correct permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 .env  # Read/write for owner only
   ```
4. **Character Encoding**: Save file as UTF-8, not UTF-8 BOM

**Prevention**:
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (already included)
- Document `.env` setup process for team members
- Use environment variable validation in applications

---

### üö´ Agent Not Found Errors

**Symptoms**: "Agent not found", "Unknown agent name", or similar errors.

**Common Agent Names** (case-sensitive):
- `content-director`
- `content-research-analyst`
- `x-poster`
- `linkedin-content-specialist`
- `email-marketing-specialist`
- `long-form-content-writer`
- `visual-content-strategist`

**Solutions**:
1. **Spelling Check**: Verify exact agent name spelling
2. **Case Sensitivity**: Use lowercase with hyphens
3. **Agent Location**: Ensure agent files are in `.claude/agents/` directory
4. **File Integrity**: Check that agent `.md` files are properly formatted

**Quick Test**:
```bash
# List all available agents
ls .claude/agents/

# Check agent file format
head -10 .claude/agents/content-director.md
```

## Agent Communication Problems

### üí¨ Agent Gives Generic or Off-Brand Responses

**Symptoms**: Content doesn't match your brand voice, feels generic, lacks specificity.

**Root Causes**:
- Insufficient context in prompts
- Missing brand voice guidelines
- Vague audience definitions
- No examples provided

**Solutions**:

**Enhance Your Prompts**:
```
‚ùå Bad: "Create a LinkedIn post about our product"

‚úÖ Good: "Use linkedin-content-specialist to create a LinkedIn post about our new CRM software:

Target Audience: Small business owners (10-50 employees) who currently use spreadsheets for customer tracking
Brand Voice: Friendly expert - like a knowledgeable consultant, not corporate/salesy
Key Message: CRM doesn't have to be complicated or expensive
Tone: Helpful and encouraging, focus on solving real problems
Include: Specific pain point (lost customer data), our solution (simple interface), social proof
Reference Style: Similar to HubSpot's educational content but more accessible
Call-to-Action: Download free CRM buyer's guide"
```

**Provide Context Templates**:
```
Brand Voice Reference:
- Personality: [Authoritative but approachable/Casual and friendly/etc.]
- Avoid: [Jargon, hype words, overly technical language]
- Include: [Data-driven insights, practical examples, personal stories]
- Tone: [Professional, conversational, educational, etc.]
- Similar to: [Competitor or publication you admire]

Target Audience:
- Demographics: [Age, role, company size, industry]
- Pain Points: [Specific challenges they face]
- Goals: [What they're trying to achieve]
- Experience Level: [Beginner, intermediate, expert]
- Decision Factors: [What influences their choices]
```

**Create Brand Guidelines Document**:
```
Use content-director to review and memorize our brand guidelines:

Brand Voice: Professional but approachable, like a knowledgeable friend
Key Messages: [Your core value propositions]
Audience: [Primary customer personas]
Tone Examples: [Link to existing content you love]
Avoid: [Things that don't align with your brand]
Competitive Differentiation: [What makes you unique]

Use these guidelines for all future content creation.
```

### üîÑ Agent Responses Are Too Similar or Repetitive

**Symptoms**: Content feels repetitive, agents use similar phrases, lack of variety.

**Solutions**:

**Vary Your Prompts**:
```
# Instead of always asking for "a LinkedIn post"
Use linkedin-content-specialist to create a poll about remote work challenges
Use linkedin-content-specialist to write a personal story about career challenges
Use linkedin-content-specialist to create an industry trend analysis post
Use linkedin-content-specialist to write a contrarian take on marketing automation
```

**Request Different Formats**:
```
Use x-poster to create content in these formats:
- Question thread (5 tweets asking thought-provoking questions)
- Myth-busting thread (7 tweets debunking common misconceptions)
- Resource thread (10 tweets with tools and links)
- Personal story thread (narrative format, 6 tweets)
- Statistics thread (data-heavy, 8 tweets with sources)
```

**Use Different Angles**:
```
Same Topic, Different Angles:
- Beginner's perspective: "Getting started with..."
- Expert analysis: "Advanced strategies for..."
- Common mistakes: "Why most people fail at..."
- Future trends: "What's coming next in..."
- Contrarian view: "Why everyone is wrong about..."
```

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Agents Take Too Long to Respond

**Symptoms**: Long wait times, timeouts, slow content generation.

**Diagnosis**:
- Complex prompts requiring extensive research
- API rate limiting
- High service demand
- Network connectivity issues

**Solutions**:

**Optimize Prompt Complexity**:
```
‚ùå Complex: "Use content-director to research market trends, analyze 5 competitors, create a 6-week campaign with 50+ pieces of content across all platforms, including detailed analytics strategy and budget allocation"

‚úÖ Simplified: "Use content-research-analyst to identify top 3 market trends in [industry] this month"

Then: "Use content-director to create a 2-week campaign based on these trends: [paste results]"
```

**Break Down Large Requests**:
```
# Instead of one massive request, use sequential steps:
Step 1: Research phase
Step 2: Strategy development  
Step 3: Content creation
Step 4: Optimization and refinement
```

**Use Batch Processing**:
```
# Create multiple pieces of similar content together
Use x-poster to create 5 Twitter threads about different aspects of email marketing:
1. List building strategies
2. Subject line optimization
3. Automation sequences
4. Performance tracking
5. Common mistakes
```

---

## API and Service Issues

### üö® Rate Limiting Errors

**Symptoms**: "Rate limit exceeded", "Too many requests", temporary blocks.

**Common Rate Limits**:
- **Anthropic Claude**: 60 requests/minute, 40,000 tokens/minute
- **Twitter API**: 300 tweets per 3 hours, 50 requests per 15 minutes
- **LinkedIn API**: 500 requests per day
- **Google Search API**: 100 requests per day (free tier)

**Solutions**:

**Immediate Fixes**:
```bash
# Wait for rate limit reset (check service documentation)
# Twitter: 15-minute windows
# Most APIs: 1-hour reset periods
```

**Long-term Strategies**:
- **Batch Requests**: Combine multiple tasks in single API calls
- **Strategic Timing**: Spread requests throughout the day
- **Upgrade Plans**: Consider higher-tier API plans for production use
- **Content Scheduling**: Plan content creation during off-peak hours

**Rate Limit Management**:
```
Use content-director to create this week's content in one session:

Plan all content first, then create in batches:
Batch 1: Monday-Wednesday content (all LinkedIn posts)
Batch 2: Thursday-Friday content (all Twitter content)  
Batch 3: Email and blog content
Batch 4: Visual content strategy and image generation

This minimizes API calls and stays within rate limits.
```

---

### üîå Service Outages and Downtime

**Symptoms**: "Service unavailable", connection errors, unexpected failures.

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Check Service Status**:
   - Anthropic: [status.anthropic.com](https://status.anthropic.com)
   - Twitter: [api.twitterstat.us](https://api.twitterstat.us)
   - LinkedIn: LinkedIn Developer Status (check their documentation)

2. **Use Alternative Services**:
   ```
   # If Anthropic is down, use OpenRouter
   Configure OPENROUTER_API_KEY in .env file
   
   # If primary email service fails, use SMTP backup
   Configure SMTP settings in .env file
   ```

3. **Manual Fallbacks**:
   - Create content manually using agent guidelines
   - Use saved templates and frameworks
   - Postpone posting until services recover

**Prevention**:
- Set up multiple API service accounts
- Monitor service status pages
- Have manual content creation backup plans
- Keep content templates for emergencies

---

### üí∞ Unexpected High API Costs

**Symptoms**: Higher than expected API bills, rapid credit consumption.

**Cost Analysis**:
```bash
# Check current usage (varies by service)
# Anthropic: Check usage in console
# OpenRouter: Monitor tokens in dashboard
# Twitter: Review API usage statistics
```

**Cost Optimization Strategies**:

**Reduce Token Usage**:
```
‚ùå Expensive: "Create a comprehensive 5000-word analysis of every marketing trend in the past year with detailed competitor analysis, case studies, and implementation guides"

‚úÖ Efficient: "Create a 1500-word overview of top 3 marketing trends this quarter with 1 example each"
```

**Batch Similar Content**:
```
# Create multiple pieces efficiently
Use x-poster to create 5 tweets about different email marketing tips:
[Provide all 5 topics at once rather than 5 separate requests]
```

**Use Appropriate Models**:
- Use faster, cheaper models for simple tasks
- Reserve premium models for complex, high-value content
- Consider using templates for routine content

**Monitor and Budget**:
- Set up billing alerts in API dashboards
- Track usage per campaign to understand costs
- Calculate ROI: content performance vs. API costs
